                    <h4 id="problem1-wellbeing-of-the-elderly">Problem1: wellbeing of the elderly</h4>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, over 20% of people over the age of 60 suffer from a mental or neurological disorder[1].  There are many risk factors for mental health that can occur at any point in life, but elderly are especially vulnerable because they also have other life stressor that happen later in life[2].   Some examples are loss in capabilities, chronic pain, stereotyping and prejudice[3] . These stressors can lead the elderly to isolate themselves, suffer from loneliness and psychological distress.</p>
<p>We are aiming to solve these issues with the help of our application. We want to help stimulate senior’s cognitive through fun mini games. We want to help them stay alert  and relax and have fun. These games can also be played with friends and family and we hope the application will alleviate their sense of loneliness.</p>
<h4 id="problem-2-technology">Problem 2: technology</h4>
<p>There is no denying that we are in the digital age. It is a wonderful place to be but can also be a daunting place for someone that is not familiar with technology.  One generation that seem to suffer the most in this era are the elderly.</p>
<p>The pace of technological change is faster than the ability for seniors to adopt these new concepts. This implies that as technology continues to evolve it becomes more daunting and foreign for seniors to adapt. Through surveys and research, we believe that our application will tackle the barriers that seniors encounter with technology.</p>
<p>We believe our application will be appealing and successful towards that target audience because it will be catered to their needs.  Our application will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>More comprehensive with the use of text and images as a combination, to help them associate icons with their meaning</li>
<li>Tutorials will be included and always available that explains how the app functions and what the buttons are doing</li>
<li>Stimulating mini games that engages the brain</li>
</ul>
<p>We want our application to be both a game but also an enjoyable experience with new technology and to entice them to explore the digital world. We want the seniors to feel a sense of accomplishment and demonstrate to them that they are not obsolete and are still contributing members of the society. We want to arm the elderly and boost their confidence that you can never be too old to learn new things and learning can be fun!</p>

<p>According to research, video games are still part of boomers’ lives. Adults between the ages of 55-64 still enjoy game genre like card,puzzle and virtual board game. This tells us that we can make games similar to what they are used too and limit the technological gap.[4]</p>

<h2 id="surveys">Surveys</h2>
<p>We organized a survey to have a better understanding of the older one&rsquo;s vision about technology and what are the pain points and the benefits they fin using various applications. The total population of our survey is 12 people from two different groups: the ones between 50 and 69 years old (which consist in 8 people) and people over 70 years old (consisting in 4 individuals). <br>
<br>
We interviewed them to know the importance they give to technology.<br>
<img src="/images/chart1.png" alt="surverChart"> 
We can easily observe that the younger population uses more applications to help them daily than the older population (75% for the people between 50 and 69 years old versus 50% for individuals over 70).<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/chart2.png" alt="surverChart">
Older people use more generally applications to maintain their mental health rather than their physical wellbeing. <br>
This can be observed in both age groups: 100% of the people over 70 in our survey use apps for their mental wellbeing and 90% of people between 50 and 69 years old also use applications to help their mental health (these numbers include those who also use technology for both physical and mental health.)</p>

                    <p>Our survey and research let us find three typical profiles that we designed into user personas.</p>
<h5 id="christine-rogers">Christine Rogers</h5>
<p>Christine is someone willing to learn and interested in technology. She wants to improve her knowledge and have a better usage of application in her everyday life. 
<img src="/images/Persona-1.png" alt="persona"></p>
<h5 id="geraldine-roy">Geraldine Roy</h5>
<p>Geraldine is a woman in the same age frame than Christine, but which profile is very different. Geraldine does not particularly need technology in her life, thus does not want to learn how to use applications. However, she benefits from technology and acknowledges that it may make life easier for some people.
<img src="/images/Persona-2.png" alt="persona"></p>
<h5 id="steven-mcmillan">Steven McMillan</h5>
<p>Steven is interested in technology and using various application to maintain or improve his mental and physical health. He belongs to the younger group we formed previously (younger than 70).

                    <h5 id="initial-sketch">Initial Sketch</h5>
<p>As part of our app design, and to gain more understanding and visualisation of our app, we created some sketches for the most frequently used pages. 
Our first iteration follows.</p>
<p><figure><img src="images/sketch-full-before-edit.png"/>
</figure>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="revised-sketch">Revised Sketch</h5>
<p>After further consideration, some modifications were done.
They were mainly focused on layout modification to reduce the amount of games listed per row on the page, and in turn, a reduction of the overall amount of games per page.
Moreover, some modifications to button and functionality availability was also suggested.
For example, an &lsquo;add to favourites&rsquo; and a game &lsquo;tutorial&rsquo; button were added to the game screen for a more complete and accessible functionality.
The second iteration of the sketches is shown below.</p>

Each of the pages in the sketches was modelled to get a more visually refined version of our application design.
The mockup is shown below.</p>
