## Studies

According to research, video games are still part of boomersâ€™ lives. Adults between the ages of 55-64 still enjoy game genre like card,puzzle and virtual board game. This tells us that we can make games similar to what they are used too and limit the technological gap.[4]

## Surveys
We organized a survey to have a better understanding of the older one's vision about technology and what are the pain points and the benefits they fin using various applications. The total population of our survey is 12 people from two different groups: the ones between 50 and 69 years old \(which consist in 8 people\) and people over 70 years old \(consisting in 4 individuals\). \
\
We interviewed them to know the importance they give to technology.\

We can easily observe that the younger population uses more applications to help them daily than the older population \(75% for the people between 50 and 69 years old versus 50% for individuals over 70\).\

Older people use more generally applications to maintain their mental health rather than their physical wellbeing. \
This can be observed in both age groups: 100% of the people over 70 in our survey use apps for their mental wellbeing and 90% of people between 50 and 69 years old also use applications to help their mental health \(these numbers include those who also use technology for both physical and mental health.\)
