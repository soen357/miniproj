## Studies
We organized a survey to have a better understanding of the older one's vision about technology and what are the pain points and the benefits they fin using various applications. The total population of our survey is 12 people from two different groups: the ones between 50 and 69 years old \(which consist in 8 people\) and people over 70 years old \(consisting in 4 individuals\).
We interviewed them to know which kind of application they generally use and for which purpose. Our survey is based on the usage of applications to maintain the mental or physical health of the elderly. We divided the answers into the two described groups, since they answers were different.
