##### Initial Sketch
As part of our app design, and to gain more understanding and visualisation of our app, we created some sketches for the most frequently used pages. 
Our first iteration follows.

##### Revised Sketch
After further consideration, some modifications were done.
They were mainly focused on layout modification to reduce the amount of games listed per row on the page, and in turn, a reduction of the overall amount of games per page.
Moreover, some modifications to button and functionality availability was also suggested.
For example, an 'add to favourites' and a game 'tutorial' button were added to the game screen for a more complete and accessible functionality.
The second iteration of the sketches is shown below.
