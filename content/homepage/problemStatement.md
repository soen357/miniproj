#### Problem1: wellbeing of the elderly
According to the World Health Organization, over 20% of people over the age of 60 suffer from a mental or neurological disorder[1].  There are many risk factors for mental health that can occur at any point in life, but elderly are especially vulnerable because they also have other life stressor that happen later in life[2].   Some examples are loss in capabilities, chronic pain, stereotyping and prejudice[3] . These stressors can lead the elderly to isolate themselves, suffer from loneliness and psychological distress.

We are aiming to solve these issues with the help of our application. We want to help stimulate seniorâ€™s cognitive through fun mini games. We want to help them stay alert  and relax and have fun. These games can also be played with friends and family and we hope the application will alleviate their sense of loneliness.

#### Problem 2: technology
There is no denying that we are in the digital age. It is a wonderful place to be but can also be a daunting place for someone that is not familiar with technology.  One generation that seem to suffer the most in this era are the elderly.

The pace of technological change is faster than the ability for seniors to adopt these new concepts. This implies that as technology continues to evolve it becomes more daunting and foreign for seniors to adapt. Through surveys and research, we believe that our application will tackle the barriers that seniors encounter with technology.

We believe our application will be appealing and successful towards that target audience because it will be catered to their needs.  Our application will be:
-	More comprehensive with the use of text and images as a combination, to help them associate icons with their meaning
-	Tutorials will be included and always available that explains how the app functions and what the buttons are doing
-	Stimulating mini games that engages the brain

We want our application to be both a game but also an enjoyable experience with new technology and to entice them to explore the digital world. We want the seniors to feel a sense of accomplishment and demonstrate to them that they are not obsolete and are still contributing members of the society. We want to arm the elderly and boost their confidence that you can never be too old to learn new things and learning can be fun!
