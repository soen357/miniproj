As we progress in time, more and more of the information, activities and how we get that information are moving on the web. In the good old days, if someone needed to find let’s say a pair of shoes, they would go to their local mall and find a store that sell shoes. You could look in the phone book and get information on stores and activities you wanted to do.

For people that have been born in the digital age, these might seems obvious, but for someone who had an already working system on how to find things, this might be a challenge for them. What seems for us easy and obvious might not be for them.

For that generation, even if they have let’s say a phone, they don’t necessarily know how to use it and they always need to rely on others to get to where they want,

Our application will be focusing on the mental wellbeing of the elderly through fun mini games that can be played solo or with friends. We believe our application will be appealing and successful towards that target audience because it will be catered to their needs.  Our application will be:
-	More comphrensive with the use of text and images as a combination, to help them associate icons with their meaning
-	Tutorials will be included and always available that explains how the app functions and what the buttons are doing
-	Stimulating mini games that engages your brain

We want our application to be both a game but also an enjoyable experience with new technology and to entice them to explore the digital world. We want to arm the elderly and boost their confidence that you can never be too old to learn new things and learning can be fun!
